## Notes

the video demonstration was very very slightly different from the version of xcode that I had used...When trying to get the simulation to work with the iphone5s size the app would not be sized correctly to fill the screen...but when switching to any model of iphone larger (iphone 6 - X) the app was able to be viewed normally
